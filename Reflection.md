# Reflection – Phase II: Desktop Website Development

##  Overview
In this phase of the SDA101 continuous assessment, I converted my Phase I Figma design into a functional **HTML + Tailwind CSS** website.  
This project helped me translate design concepts into structured, styled, and visually cohesive web pages.

---

##  What I Learned
- **Tailwind CSS utility classes:** I learned how to build an entire layout quickly using Tailwind’s pre-defined classes instead of writing long CSS files.  
- **Design translation:** I recreated my Figma layout with accurate spacing, color, and alignment using HTML structure and responsive utilities.  
- **Consistent styling:** I maintained a uniform purple theme to reflect my personal brand identity.  
- **Deployment process:** I practiced publishing my code on **GitHub Pages**, ensuring that the site runs smoothly online.

---

##  Challenges Faced
- Understanding how Tailwind class names interact with layout positioning at first.  
- Adjusting the spacing and proportions so that my design matched the Figma version.  
- Balancing simplicity and creativity while following a minimal, professional layout.

---

##  Key Takeaways
- Tailwind CSS makes styling fast, flexible, and visually consistent.  
- Clean code and semantic HTML structure improve maintainability.  
- I gained confidence in turning UI designs into working websites.  
- This phase strengthened my foundation for creating responsive designs in the next phase.

##  Next Steps
For **Phase III**, I plan to:
- Add responsiveness for mobile and tablet screens using Tailwind’s responsive classes.  
- Improve accessibility and text readability.  
- Optimize images and implement optional dark mode.
